# Developement
1.Organization of components
The app includes App.js, DisplayList.js, FilteredList.js, and ShopList.js.

2.How data is passed down through components?
All data is passed down through components by using props.

3. How the user trigger state changes?
I used this.setState to set state, and user could push the number of plant button on the interface to trigger state changes.
